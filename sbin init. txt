On modern Linux systems (RHEL 7, 8, and 9), the init process is the first userspace process started by the kernel during system boot. Historically, /sbin/init was a standalone binary responsible for initializing system services in a sequential manner.
In current Red Hat–based systems, /sbin/init is a symbolic link to systemd, which is the modern init system and service manager. The kernel always starts the process with PID 1, and this role is fulfilled by systemd.
systemd is responsible for:
system initialization,
mounting filesystems,
starting and supervising services,
managing dependencies,
enabling parallel service startup for faster boot times.
Instead of legacy runlevels, systemd uses targets (such as multi-user.target or graphical.target) and relies on unit files (services, mounts, sockets, timers) to define system behavior.
The /sbin/init symbolic link exists primarily for backward compatibility with older tools and scripts that still reference it.
If this link is missing, corrupted, or inconsistent, the system may experience:
boot failures,
unstable service behavior,
or unexpected runtime anomalies.
 In summary, /sbin/init is a critical component of the Linux boot process, and any modification or corruption of this link directly impacts overall system stability.
