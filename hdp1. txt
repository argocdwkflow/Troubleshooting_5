Root Cause Analysis – vSAN Write Latency (Hadoop Cluster)
On January 19th between 15:50 and 16:05, a temporary increase in vSAN write latency was observed on the Hadoop cluster.
Detailed analysis shows that the Linux operating system and the underlying infrastructure were healthy, with no CPU, memory, or local disk saturation.
The Hadoop DataNode logs reported repeated WRITE_BLOCK errors during the same period. Although the Linux filesystem /hadoop was used at approximately 75%, which is acceptable at OS level, the effective available space at the HDFS layer dropped below critical thresholds. This triggered HDFS write retries, increased spill activity, and block replication pressure.
As a result, multiple DataNodes generated a high volume of simultaneous write operations, causing a temporary congestion on the vSAN backend and increased write latency.
No infrastructure fault was identified. The root cause is related to Hadoop capacity management and workload behavior under reduced HDFS free space.
Recommended actions include freeing HDFS space, reviewing quotas, and improving capacity monitoring.
If you want, I can also provide a short executive version or a customer-friendly email format.

Parfait 👍
Voici un commentaire clair, professionnel et cohérent avec Dynatrace, prêt à être collé tel quel dans l’incident (≈120–150 mots).
Dynatrace Root Cause Confirmation – Hadoop Disk Latency
Dynatrace analysis confirms that all related incidents share the same root cause.
On January 19th between 15:50 and 16:05, the host s02vl9932901.fr.net.intra experienced a slow disk event on filesystem /hadoop, with disk write time peaking above 250 ms.
The anomaly correlates with a strong increase in write activity generated by Hadoop workloads. Although the Linux filesystem usage was around 75% (acceptable at OS level), the effective HDFS free space dropped below safe thresholds, triggering HDFS write retries and WRITE_BLOCK errors on DataNodes.
These retries caused a temporary surge in write operations, leading to backend storage congestion (vSAN) and increased disk write latency detected by Dynatrace.
No infrastructure or OS failure was identified.
The root cause is Hadoop capacity pressure and workload behavior, not a storage or virtualization defect.
Recommended actions: free HDFS space, review quotas, and improve capacity monitoring.
