On a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.9 server, executing the command mount -av causes the operating system to verify and attempt to mount or re-mount all filesystems defined in /etc/fstab. During this process, the mount points related to the IBM MQ Queue Manager FRPCL01P generate the messages “resource is busy or already mounted” and “timeout set”.
This behavior is expected and does not indicate a failure. The NFS filesystem hosting IBM MQ data and transaction logs (/var/mqm/qmgrs and /var/mqm/log) is already mounted and actively used. IBM MQ continuously holds open and locked files, especially its binary transaction log files (Sxxxxx.LOG), to guarantee transactional integrity. Because these files are in use, the Linux kernel correctly blocks any remount attempt and reports the filesystem as busy.
The timeout message is informational and does not reflect a network or storage issue. On RHEL 7.9, when using NFSv4.x, the client must validate lock state and session information before completing a mount operation. If active locks are detected, the NFS client enters a controlled wait period, which results in the timeout message before the mount attempt is aborted.
There is no impact on IBM MQ operations. The Queue Manager remains in Running state, no in-doubt or prepared transactions are reported, and no data corruption is detected. Other filesystems and MQ queue managers are unaffected.
Solution and Recommended Actions
No action is required during normal operations. The message can safely be ignored while IBM MQ is running.
Avoid running mount -av on MQ servers during production unless required.
If a remount is necessary, perform it during a maintenance window:
Stop the Queue Manager (endmqm -i FRPCL01P)
Unmount and remount the filesystem
Restart the Queue Manager (strmqm FRPCL01P)
For long-term stability on RHEL 7.9, NFSv3 is recommended for IBM MQ environments, as it provides simpler lock handling and more predictable behavior.
